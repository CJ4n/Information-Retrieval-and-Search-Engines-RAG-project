# Information Retrieval and Search Engines Project

Project for the course "Information Retrieval and Search Engines" at the KU Leuven.

Project contains a information retrieval system that was evaluated on number of datasets and metrics, resulting in a final presentation.

Project uses mostly plain Python for almost whole implementation.

Scope of this project was research and education, not production, thus it was not optimized for performance or scalability or maintainability.

To run project install dependencies specified in pyproject.toml.

I recommend using UV package manager.

1. uv venv
2. uv sync
3. uv run src/main.py
