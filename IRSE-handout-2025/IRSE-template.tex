\section{\LaTeX{} syntax for floats}
Figures and tables will stay in one column with \verb|\begin{figure}| and \verb|\begin{table}| and you can allow them to stretch across both columns with \verb|\begin{figure*}| and \verb|\begin{table*}|.

\section{\LaTeX{} syntax for citations}
You can cite sources like \textcite{ouyang_training_2022}.

\section{Style tips}
Highly recommended is to render your figures as PDFs. For block diagrams, we recommend \href{https://draw.io}{\texttt{draw.io}}. For other visuals (graphs, histograms, bar plots, numerical tables ...) we suggest the \href{https://github.com/bauwenst/fiject}{\texttt{fiject}} Python package.

If you want inspiration about how you could format queries and responses, you could check out the GPT-4 paper \parencite{bubeck_sparks_2023}.
