Beets are typically boiled or roasted before being added to the borscht, which helps release their natural sweetness and earthy undertones. However, it's important to note that other ingredients such as tomatoes, onions, potatoes, garlic, and cabbage also play significant roles in creating the rich and complex taste profile of borscht.</s>\n"
